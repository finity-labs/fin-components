# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Permission gating for custom actions** — `Preview`, `SendTest`, `Compose` (Email Templates) and `Resend` (Sent Emails) are now hidden from the UI when Filament Shield is installed and the authenticated user lacks the corresponding permission. Falls back to the previous always-visible behavior when Shield is absent, so existing installs are unaffected (#12, thanks @agencetwogether)
- `FinMailPlugin::isShieldAvailable()` helper for checking Shield presence
- `preview_heading` translation key for the preview modal header, populated across all 58 supported locales

### Changed

- `InstallCommand` now seeds `preview`, `sendTest`, `compose`, and `resend` into the Filament Shield config so `shield:generate` produces the matching policy methods and permissions
- Bulk delete on the Email Templates table now uses `authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')` when Shield is active

### Notes

- After upgrading on a Shield-enabled install, run `php artisan shield:generate --panel=admin --option=policies_and_permissions` to register the new permissions

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Pass extra view data to email templates** — New `extraData()` method (and native `with()` support) on `TemplateMail` for passing variables directly to the Blade view, separate from the token replacement system. Useful for view-only data that doesn't need to flow through the token engine (#10, thanks @agencetwogether)

### Fixed

- Reply-To section was missing from the email template infolist (view page). It's now displayed alongside the Custom Sender section (#11, thanks @agencetwogether)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Reply-To support for templates** — Each template can now have its own reply-to address and name, configurable from the template settings tab. Falls back to `null` if not set, so existing templates are unaffected. The `TemplateMail` mailable also gains an `overrideReplyTo()` setter for runtime overrides (#9, thanks @agencetwogether)
- Reply-to translations added to all 58 supported locales

### Notes

- A new migration is included (`add_reply_to_on_email_templates_table`). Run `php artisan migrate` after upgrading.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- Migrations now use configured table names from `fin-mail.php` config instead of hardcoded defaults, fixing issues with foreign key references when table names are customized (#7, thanks @agencetwogether)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Custom block registration** — Register your own editor blocks via `FinMailPlugin::make()->customBlocks([...])`. Custom blocks now render correctly in the editor, preview mode, and sent emails. ButtonBlock is always included by default. Closes #6

### Changed

- Block rendering in `EmailTemplate`, `TipTapConverter`, and `DefaultEditor` now reads from a dynamic plugin-level registry instead of a hardcoded list

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Configurable date formatting** — New `date_format` and `datetime_format` config options, supporting a single string or a per-locale array. When null, Filament's defaults apply. Includes `FinMail::dateFormat()` and `FinMail::dateTimeFormat()` facade helpers
- **Token fields in test email modal** — Send test email modal now shows input fields for documented tokens (excluding `config.*` and `user.*`), pre-filled with example values from the token schema
- **Full rendered body storage** — Sent emails now store the complete HTML as actually delivered (layout, theme, branding, footer), not just the inner body content
- **Sent email infolist** — Sent email preview replaced with a proper Filament infolist using `TextEntry`, `ViewEntry`, and badge components
- **Laravel 13 support**
- **`@property` annotations on SentEmail model** for PHPStan

### Fixed

- Test emails sent from the template list now go through `EmailSender`, so they appear in the sent emails log
- Sent email preview now renders with full styling via base64 iframe, matching what was actually delivered
- Missing translations for `versioning.preview`, `sent.preview.*`, `settings.sections.add_additional_senders`, and `settings.sections.add_footer_links` across all 58 non-en/fr languages

### Changed

- All date/datetime displays across the plugin now use the configured format from `config/fin-mail.php`
- Sent email relation manager preview uses the shared `SentEmailInfolist` schema instead of a blade view
- Screenshots section in README uses collapsible `<details>` tags

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Version History UI** — Version history now displays in a proper Filament table with per-row preview and restore actions
- **Version Preview** — Preview any version's email content directly from the version history modal
- **Version Restore** — Restore any previous version with one click; current content is automatically saved as a new version first
- **Upgrade Command** — New `php artisan fin-mail:upgrade` command to migrate existing data after package updates (supports `--dry-run`)

### Fixed

- **Versioning not working** — Version cleanup query was deleting all versions instead of keeping the most recent ones
- **Version history crash** — Subject column was passed as an array to `Str::limit()`, causing a TypeError
- **Seeded template buttons stripped by editor** — Inline-styled `<a>` tags in seeded templates (Password Reset, Verify Email) were stripped by TipTap due to `font-weight: 600` conflicting with the link mark; buttons now use the native `customBlock` format
- **Custom blocks not rendered in previews** — Button blocks stored as `<div data-type="customBlock">` were not converted to visible HTML in the View page preview and Compose page preview
- **Button preview ignores theme colors** — Button block preview in the RichEditor now reflects the selected template theme instead of hardcoded colors; updates live when changing the theme dropdown

### Changed

- **Translations** — Added `blocks` and `versioning` translation keys for all 59 supported languages
- Button block default label and preview label now use translation keys instead of hardcoded English
- `renderCustomBlocks()` is now public for use by preview components
- Versions relationship eager-loads `createdBy` to prevent lazy loading violations

### Upgrading from 1.1.0

If you have existing seeded templates with buttons (Password Reset, Verify Email), run the upgrade command to convert them to the new format:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:upgrade
```

You can preview what would change first with `--dry-run`:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:upgrade --dry-run
```

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Merge Tags in RichEditor** — Tokens defined in the Tokens tab now appear as merge tags in the editor toolbar, allowing easy insertion without switching tabs
- **CTA Button Block** — New custom block for inserting styled call-to-action buttons with configurable label, URL, and alignment, themed automatically
- **Inline Link Styling** — Links in email body now receive inline theme colors for email clients that strip `<style>` blocks
- **Live Theme Preview** — Color changes in the theme editor update the preview immediately without saving
- **Custom Theme Auto-Registration** — Install command detects custom Filament theme CSS and registers FinMail styles; uninstall cleans up

### Fixed

- Link colors not applied in email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Email preview now shows current form content and selected theme instead of last saved state
- TipTap merge tag nodes properly converted to `{{ token }}` text in preview and sent emails
- Token replacement now works on compose page emails (override body)
- Replicate action for templates and themes — modal shows editable name/key fields, excludes computed columns, redirects to edit page
- Uninstall command handles fluent plugin configuration
- Portuguese translations

### Changed

- Compose page defaults "To" field to logged-in user's email
- Email preview uses Filament's RichContentRenderer for proper HTML conversion (includes Link extension)
