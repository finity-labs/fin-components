/*
 * SCOPE-04's seam: "what would a reader standing in panel X see?", asked of the
 * gate itself rather than answered a second time beside it.
 *
 * Every row drives the verdicts through the core, exactly as PanelScopeGateTest
 * does — the decorated ContentSource filtered by lin-codex's own ArticleGate —
 * so what these rows pin is what the drawer, the hints, search and the Help
 * Center all get.
 *
 * The viewer of record is one the host policy lets read every panel, because
 * that is the viewer the filter exists for: without the seam the rule is lifted
 * for exactly that viewer and every panel option would answer "everything".
 *
 * One panel per test method, as everywhere else in this directory: Filament
 * boots the first panel of a PHP request cycle only. Articles are seeded before
 * the first read, so no memo needs dropping.
 *
 * The helpers are file-local and prefixed, the way PanelScopeSurfacesTest's are:
 * Pest's are global for the whole run but only for the files the run actually
 * loads, so calling PanelScopeGateTest's set from here would leave this file
 * unrunnable on its own. They seed the same six-article set that file reads the
 * panel rule off, and the two must stay in step.
