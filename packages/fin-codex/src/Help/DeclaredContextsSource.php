/**
 * Folds code-declared help into lin-codex as ordinary contexts. Wrapped
 * around the core's own ContentSource, it appends the panel-scoped synthetic
 * contexts of DeclaredContexts to every declared article that exists,
 * records their string forms on the article's meta under META_KEY, and adds
 * one SourceWarning per declared slug that has no article. Everything else
 * is the inner source's answer: undeclared articles pass through untouched,
 * the tree and the search documents are delegated because contexts influence
 * neither (and rebuilding an ArticleSet for the tree would drop its folder
 * groups), and findByContext() runs the core's ArticleSet over the decorated
 * map so the exact-match rules stay the core's.
 *
 * The decorator never filters, reorders or looks at the viewer: the core's
 * gate decides who may read an article, and ContextIndex orders and
 * de-duplicates the merged contexts. all() is rebuilt on every call because
 * database articles change between requests; the rebuild touches only the
 * declared slugs, so it costs O(declarations), not O(articles).
 *
 * META_KEY exists for two later consumers. Phase 5's editor lists the
 * synthetic contexts read-only as "declared in code", and any exporter that
 * is fed a decorated article must leave the key and the marked contexts out
 * of front matter (FrontMatterWriter writes every meta key). The core's own
 * ArticleExporter injects DatabaseSource directly, so codex:export never
 * sees them today.
