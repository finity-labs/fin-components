/**
 * fin-codex:install brings a host from "composer require" to a panel that
 * carries the help drawer, the article editor, the settings page and the
 * coverage page, with its languages configured and a first set of articles
 * about the help system itself.
 *
 * It deliberately owns very little. Articles, media, revisions, settings and
 * the search index all belong to lin-codex, which ships its own installer, so
 * this command points at (or calls) `codex:install` and never migrates a core
 * table or publishes a core asset itself. Its one reach into lin-codex is the
 * config file: since 0.5.0 the install switches the core's public help center
 * off, and publishing that file is the only way to write the value.
 * What is left is genuinely fin-codex's:
 * the plugin registration in a panel provider, the languages the editor
 * offers, the starter articles, the two optional publish groups this package
 * has (translations and views), and the Filament Shield wiring for the
 * article resource. The panel-provider and Shield edits are fin-support's,
 * the language prompt is lin-support's.
 *
 * The AI translation step is the one optional extra, behind --ai (answer
 * its question with yes) and --ai-only (run nothing else). It asks for the
 * same three things the settings page asks for - provider, model and key -
 * tests the connection once and saves them together, so a host can go from
 * composer require to a working Translate with AI button without opening the
 * panel. It offers to install the optional SDK when it is missing and then
 * stops, because the running process cannot see a package composer has just
 * written. A non-interactive run without either flag never mentions AI.
 *
 * Every step is safe to repeat. The plugin registration refuses a second
 * `FinCodexPlugin::make()`, the Shield insertion refuses a second
 * `FinityLabs\FinCodex` entry, the starter import skips an article whose
 * slug already exists, and vendor:publish skips files that already exist
 * unless --force is passed.

     * means a host who installed before a docs rewrite never sees the new
     * text. The question per slug and configured language is whether the

     * the starter manifest (Starter\StarterManifest) answers:
     *
     * 1. the row carries the text this version ships: nothing to do, and
     *    nothing to say about it;
     * 2. the row carries a text an earlier version shipped: refresh it;
     * 3. the row carries anything else: the host wrote it, so it is only
     *    named, never touched;
     * 4. there is no row in a configured language: fill it in, which is how
     *    a language added after the install finally gets the starter set.
     *
     * The manifest, not the timestamps, decides — a save moves updated_at,
     * the refresh's own included, so a timestamp rule could refresh a row
     * once and never again. Case 3 is deliberately generous: an AI
     * translation, a hand edit, even a wording change of one letter all
     * leave a text the package never shipped, and all are left alone.
     *
     * An article whose rows carry no shipped text in any language is not a
     * starter article at all as far as this command can tell — a host may
     * have written an article of their own under one of these slugs before
     * installing — so it is named and left whole, and no language is filled
     * in beside it.
