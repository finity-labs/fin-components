/**
 * Translate missing, the row's second action beside Edit.
 *
 * Edit's neighbour, and the one way to fill every gap of an article without
 * opening the editor at all: the modal lists the languages this article still
 * lacks, pre-checked, and the ticked ones are handed to lin-codex's queued
 * translation job. The work runs in the background and the list's flags show
 * the result on the next load; nothing is translated inline here, unlike the
 * tab's Translate with AI.
 *
 * Only missing languages are ever listed. An outdated translation - one whose
 * default-language source was edited afterwards - is a judgement call about
 * text that already exists, so it is refreshed from the editor, where the
 * admin can read both versions first.
 *
 * Three gates, and Filament ANDs them:
 *
 * - availability. The table asks AiAvailabilityCheck once per build and hands
 *   the answer down as a bool, so every unavailable state takes the button
 *   away and the Help settings page is where the admin reads why. It is a
 *   settings read, and a settings read per row would be four on a four-row
 *   page.
 * - the ability. update on the row's article, through ArticleAbility and the
 *   closure form of authorize, never the string form: Filament unshifts the
 *   action's own record as the gate subject, so only a Closure is gated
 *   against the row it sits on (Phase 8's finding).
 * - something to translate into. MissingTranslations::for() on the same one
 *   instance the table resolved for the whole build, whose candidates are
 *   memoised, so the per-row verdict costs neither a settings query nor a
 *   translations query: the list eager-loads the relation and for() reads it.
 *   An article that lacks nothing shows no button.
 *
 * The verdict the modal shows is the verdict the worker re-checks, so the two
 * agree about what "missing" means and a language filled in between is
 * skipped rather than overwritten.
 *
 * The language list is laid out in three columns, as the bulk action's is: a
 * host with a dozen languages otherwise gets one tall column and a modal that
 * scrolls past its own submit button. An integer is a large-breakpoint count
 * in Filament, so a phone still gets the single column it has room for.
 *
 * Inside the modal, three rules:
 *
 * - at least one language. The pick is required, and the submit button is
 *   never disabled for it: an admin who unticks everything and presses is told
 *   in one sentence what to do, which a greyed button never says. The message
 *   is the field's own, so it appears under the list rather than as a toast.
 * - a blank default language explains itself. Where the editor's tab action
 *   greys its button and hangs a tooltip on it, a row has no room for one, so
 *   the button stays and the modal carries the reason instead: the modal is
 *   the only surface the admin will look at, and an absent button teaches
 *   nothing. The description says which language to fill in first and the
 *   submit button is taken away, so the modal is a message and not a form.
 * - the pick is intersected with the current verdict at submit time. A modal
 *   left open while somebody else finished a language would otherwise queue
 *   it; the job re-checks each locale itself and would skip it, but the
 *   intersection keeps the queue and the report honest in the first place.
 *   Everything ticked already filled means no job and no toast at all. The
 *   accepted values are widened to every configured non-default language for
 *   exactly this reason: a checkbox list validates its pick against the
 *   options it offers right now, and a language filled since the modal opened
 *   is no longer one of them, so the default rule would answer a stale modal
 *   with "the selection is invalid" instead of quietly doing the rest of the
 *   work. A locale that is not a configured language at all is still refused.
 *
 * The toast is a queue-time promise and nothing more: the work has not run
 * yet, so it says the languages will appear on the list when it finishes.
 * Whether the admin also gets a notification when it does is the listener's
 * business, and the job's own queue and timeout are the job's - nothing here
 * names either.
 *
 * The press does leave the listener two things: the language this panel is
 * being read in, recorded through NotificationLocale so the notification comes
 * back in it rather than in the application's own, and the panel's own id,
 * recorded through NotificationPanel so the notification is written against
 * this panel's guard and links this panel's edit page. A worker has no panel
 * to ask for either.
