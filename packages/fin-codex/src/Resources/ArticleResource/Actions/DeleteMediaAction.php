/**
 * Removing an uploaded file, unless something still shows it.
 *
 * The action is ALWAYS visible. A hidden delete reads as broken; a modal that
 * names every article and language still pointing at the file tells the admin
 * which texts to fix first. So a referenced file gets the list and a Close
 * button, and nothing else.
 *
 * There are two stops and both are needed. modalSubmitAction() removes the
 * button, which is the whole UI. The Halt inside using() covers everything
 * else — a stale browser, a direct call, a body that gained the URL while the
 * modal was open. Halt is caught by InteractsWithActions, so no notification
 * fires, which is the right outcome for "nothing happened".
 *
 * DeleteAction rather than a plain Action for the danger colour, the trash
 * icon, the confirmation and — the part that matters later — the delete
 * authorization hook Phase 8's policy work will use. using() replaces only the
 * model delete.
