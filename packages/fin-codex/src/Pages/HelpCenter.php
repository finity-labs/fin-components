/**
 * The Help Center: the whole help library inside the panel, at {panel}/help and
 * {panel}/help/{slug}, behind the panel's own auth and guard.
 *
 * ONE page class on ONE route. The slug is a single optional wildcard
 * parameter, because article slugs are path-like (account/signing-in), so
 * {panel}/help, {panel}/help/intro and {panel}/help/account/signing-in are all
 * this class. Filament builds a page's route from getRoutePath() and exposes no
 * hook for the route's own where(), so the parameter's pattern is declared
 * globally by the service provider — see SLUG_PARAMETER below.
 *
 * There is no Blade view and no custom layout: content() returns the whole
 * three-column page out of schema components and the framework's own page view
 * renders it, exactly as HelpCoverage does. A rail on the left (the contents
 * tree and the search), the article in the middle, "On this page" on the right.
 *
 * Registered on EVERY panel that carries the plugin, authoring(false)
 * included: that flag means "this panel only reads help", and this page is the
 * reading surface the button, the drawer and the field hints point at.
 *
 * Whether it carries a navigation item follows the panel's placement option,
 * and its group, sort, label and icon come from four options of their own —
 * never from navigationGroup() / navigationSort(), which stay with the three
 * authoring screens. Declaring shouldRegisterNavigation() here discards the
 * Shield trait's version, so the canAccess() conjunct is re-stated rather than
 * inherited. Under the None placement the page is still registered and
 * {panel}/help still answers: only the two menu entries go, and the drawer,
 * the field hints and a bookmark all still reach it.
 *
 * Not final: a helpCenterPage() override extends it, exactly as HelpSettings
 * and HelpCoverage are open for their own options.
 *
 * Access goes through HasPageShieldSupport, like the other two pages: Shield's
 * own permission when Shield is installed, the opt-in Gate ability
 * page_HelpCenter when it is not, open to any panel user otherwise.
